    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // const team = players
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'somename';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    const person = {
      name: 'Name Name',
      age: 20
    };
    // with Objects
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99})
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
